# MessageScheduler for Facebook
Want to send a message but not disturb your friend's sleep/work etc? (Because you're awake at 3:00 AM) Just use this program to send the messages you want at anytime!

Note: Create a "config.ini" file with Username and Password.

# Login Issues

Since fbchat is no longer supported, in your fbchat install, change _state.py line that says " **revision = int(r.text.split('"client_revision":', 1)[1].split(",", 1)[0])**" to **revision = 1**


Next: add gui list of messages with add message feature
